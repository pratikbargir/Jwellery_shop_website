                To ensure that we take care of our customers and their interests long after the 
                purchase has been made, we have listed down some useful facts about diamond and 
                gold jewellery. A diamond’s worth is judged by taking four factors into 
                consideration: Clarity, Colour, Carat and Cut, collectively known as the 4Cs of 
                a diamond.

                Tips To Take Care of Your Jewellery
            </h1>
            <ul class="points_style">
                <li class="style6">Clean your jewellery periodically using a warm mild detergent 
                    solution and a soft brush, and gently dry with a soft cloth. </li>
                <li class="style6">You can also use toothpaste to clean jewellery. </li>
                <li class="style6">Store each piece individually in a soft cloth or a clean 
                    jewellery box to avoid damage. </li>
                <li class="style6">During travel, ensure that your jewellery is well packed; use a 
                    jewellery box or suitable packing material. </li>
                <li class="style6">Keep away from heat, chemical areas etc. </li>
                <li class="style6">Get your jewellery checked for stone securing aspects by 
                    authorised personnel at least once a year. </li>
                <li class="style6">Avoid sizing of studded finger rings as doing so can weaken their 
                    stone securing. </li>
                <li class="style6">Do not spray perfume or deodorant on your jewellery. </li>

            <span class="style7">Some facts about gold: </span>
            <ul class="points_style">
                <li class="style6">Pure gold is of 1000 Fineness or 24kt purity. </li>
                <li class="style6">Pure gold is very soft and needs hardness for setting and 
                    converting it into jewellery. This is achieved by alloying it with other metals.
                </li>
                <li class="style6">Usually 22kt gold is used to make gold jewellery and 18kt gold is 
                    used for diamond-studded jewellery. </li>
                <li class="style6">Gold can be alloyed with various metals to give it colours such 
                    as pink, brown and white. </li>
