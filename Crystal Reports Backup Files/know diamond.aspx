                To ensure that we take care of our customers and their interests long after the 
                purchase has been made, we have listed down some useful facts about diamond and 
                gold jewellery. A diamond’s worth is judged by taking four factors into 
                consideration: Clarity, Colour, Carat and Cut, collectively known as the 4Cs of 
                a diamond.
            </p>
            <h1>
                Clarity
            </h1>
            <ul class="points_style">
                <li>Diamonds are mostly pure carbon. However, during crystallisation, other crystals 
                    may get trapped. These are known as ‘inclusions’. </li>
                <li>Diamonds are assigned grades between F (Flawless) and I(included). Diamonds with 
                    high clarity grades are rare and more valuable. </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>
                Colour
            </h1>
            <ul class="points_style">
                <li>Colour is the net combination of Hue, Tone and Saturation. </li>
                <li>The colour of a diamond greatly affects its value. The rule of thumb is that 
                    colourless diamonds are more valuable than coloured diamonds. </li>
                <li>Diamonds are rated from D to Z, D being colourless and Z being the most 
                    coloured. </li>
            </ul>

                Cut
            </h1>
            <ul class="points_style">
                <li>The cut of a diamond is the human contribution to enhance its beauty and value.
                </li>
                <li>It is what gives a diamond its brilliance, which is a combination of lustre, 
                    dispersion and scintillation. </li>
                <li>Few popular cuts are Round, Marquise, Emerald, Princess, Pear, Oval, Heart, 
                    Baguette and Trillion. </li>

                Carat
            </h1>
            <ul class="points_style">
                <li>‘Carat’ is the unit of weight used for all gemstones, including diamonds.
                </li>
                <li>One carat is subdivided into 100 ‘points’ and 5 carats equal 1 gram. </li>
                <li>Larger diamonds, being more rare and desirable, are more expensive than smaller 
                    ones. </li>
                <li>Prices of diamond increase with size. </li>
