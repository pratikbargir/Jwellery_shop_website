                            develops multiple new styles every month, all in keeping with the prevalent 
                            trends and designs in vogue. Every design is created with the help of advanced 
                            software technology. Careful attention is given to measurements, total diamond 
                            weights and metal thickness. A three-dimensional view of every design is created 
                            before it is approved for model making. </font></font>

                            <font color="" face="Century Gothic" size="3">This is the single most important 
                            process in manufacturing, as even a small lapse in quality will magnify itself 
                            in every consecutive stage. While traditionally models were made directly in 
                            silver, most model makers now use wax as an alternative, which is then cast in 
                            silver. Each model maker meticulously follows the designs and its measurements 
                            to the last decimal, approximations are not tolerated. Great efforts are made to 
                            ensure that each model is no less than a masterpiece in itself. </font></font>

                            <font color="" face="Century Gothic" size="3">Depending on the design, the 
                            diamonds may be set in the wax replica itself before the model is cast in gold. 
                            Alternatively, for larger stones and more intricate designs involving pavé work, 
                            bead setting, the stones are mounted only after the model is cast in gold. This 
                            ensures a more exquisite finish, with greater attention to proportions and 
                            symmetry. </font></font>
