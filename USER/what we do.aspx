                                    Maintaining a clean diamond can be difficult sometimes, as jewelry settings can 
                                    obstruct cleaning efforts, and oils, grease, and other hydrophobic materials 
                                    adhere well to a diamond’s surface. Some jewelers provide their customers with 
                                    sudsy ammonia cleaning kits. Many jewelers use steam cleaners. Some other 
                                    jewelers sell small ultrasonic cleaners.Home-based cleaning methods include 
                                    immersing the diamond in ammonia-based or ethyl alcohol-based solutions, or even 
                                    a solution of mild grease dissolving detergent and warm water. Silver jewelry 
                                    can be cleaned using aluminium foil, baking soda, and hot water. However, this 
                                    practice is not recommended by most jewelers.<br />

                <font color="" face="Century Gothic" size="3">Jewellery may be made from a wide 
                range of materials. Gemstones and similar materials such as amber and coral, 
                precious metals, beads, and shells have been widely used, and enamel has often 
                been important. In most cultures jewellery can be understood as a status symbol, 
                for its material properties, its patterns, or for meaningful symbols.Jewellery 
                has been made to adorn nearly every body part, from hairpins to toe rings, and 
                even genital jewellery. The patterns of wearing jewellery between the sexes, and 
                by children and older people can vary greatly between cultures, but adult women 
                have been the most consistent wearers of jewellery<br />

                <font color="" face="Century Gothic" size="3">Jewelry design is the art or 
                profession of designing and creating jewelry. This is one of civilization’s 
                earliest forms of decoration, dating back at least seven thousand years to the 
                oldest known human societies in Mesopotamia and Egypt. The art has taken many 
                forms throughout the centuries, from the simple beadwork of ancient times to the 
                sophisticated metalworking and gem cutting known in the modern day.<br />
